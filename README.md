# hueGame
Web game Hue is my educational project that was inspired by mobile game I Love Hue (they are almost the same).
Hue was created using HTML, CSS, JavaScript. The develpoment tools were Visual Studio Code and Figma (mostly for drawing the background image). 

In Hue player is supposed to create the correct gradient by moving the colorful squares on the screen. It is possible to move all the squares except for the fixed ones marked with white dots. If the player clicks on fixed squares they get notified (by pop-up) the square clicked is fixed and therefore it isn't possible to move it.
To move a square player should click the square they want to move. Then they click the place where they want to move the square (it has to be another square).
Every square player moves is getting bigger in size once clicked and until player clicks the place where they want to move it.

My project consists of 3 pages: startpage, main, endpage. It is better to start the game on startpage by pressing Play button. When the Play button is pressed, player is automatically directed to main page, where they play the game. When the game is won (all the squares are put to correct places), the gradient becomes seamless and the endpage opens. On the endpage the player gets notified they won. It is possible to start the game again from endpage by clicking Play again button.
All of the buttons are emphasized when a player's mouse hovers over them (Play and Play again button).
